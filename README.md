# 🎨 Real-Time Webcam Color Detector (Web App)

This is a browser-based **real-time color detector** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app accesses your webcam, captures the color from the center pixel, converts it to HSV, and then displays the closest color name — similar to how OpenCV-based detectors work in Python.

> ✅ 100% client-side — no frameworks or servers needed!
